# Pet-The-Dog
Petting is now a legitimate action that regains health

The petter gains 15% health back for petting, while the dog being pet regains 5% (Caesar CAN be pet)

Possible pet-ers:
* Villagers
* Soldiers
* Spearman
* Archers
* Knights
* Mages
* Merman
* Commanders (except Caesar. Dogs petting dogs? Ridiculous!)

Possible pet-ees:
* Dogs
* Caesar
* Turtles (they're so cute!)
